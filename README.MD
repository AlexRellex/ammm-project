# INSTRUCTIONS
Execute Main()

**NOTE: Couldn't make Instance Generator work, it produces non feasible graphs on high numbers,**
**You can still check the code in InstanceGenerator.py and ValidateConfig.py**

Use args:

**genfiles** (for instance generation)

**tests** (for running the provided .dat files)

**data** (for running custom .dat files on datafiles/ folder)


All the results are stored on .csv files on the results/ folder

**NOTE: OPL files on the OPL project/IPL_solution folder**
